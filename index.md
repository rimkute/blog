AI is advancing faster than we can secure it. The US faces a critical minerals shortage precisely when autonomous systems demand exponential compute. Understanding hundred-billion to trillion-parameter algorithms is genuinely hard—and we're deploying them in critical systems without a clear grasp of failure modes.

The winners won't be the fastest to market. They'll be technical leaders who understand their systems inside and out, grasp supply chain resilience as core business strategy, and can communicate clear vision across engineering, manufacturing, and capital allocation.

This is about real defensibility—systems that survive adversarial conditions.

I've spent years at the intersection of these problems: neural networks, automotive systems, manufacturing at scale, raising capital, and running businesses. What I've learned keeps me focused on one thing: the convergence of AI, security, and supply chain is the defining problem of the next decade.

## Why Now?

Three forces converge right now:

1. **AI Systems Are Opaque and Running Hot** — We don't fully understand neural network weight formation, yet we're deploying them in critical systems. Security researchers are only beginning to map the attack surface.

2. **US Critical Minerals Are Scarce, and Competitors Know It** — Mining capacity is geopolitically controlled. Battery demand is accelerating exponentially. Supply chain timing is misaligned with deployment timelines. This isn't abstract: it's a hardware constraint.

3. **Leadership in Deep Tech Requires Integration** — The companies that win won't be purely technical or purely operational. They'll be led by people who understand silicon, supply chains, capital, and can communicate vision when the path is unclear.

This is defensibility: not just better technology, but resilience across all three dimensions.
