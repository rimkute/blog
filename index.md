# The Convergence Problem

AI is advancing faster than we can secure it. The US faces a critical minerals shortage precisely when autonomous systems demand exponential compute. Understanding hundred-billion to trillion-parameter algorithms is genuinely hard—and we're deploying them in critical systems without a clear grasp of failure modes.

The winners won't be the fastest to market. They'll be technical leaders who understand their systems inside and out, grasp supply chain resilience as core business strategy, and can communicate clear vision across engineering, manufacturing, and capital allocation.

This is about real defensibility—systems that survive adversarial conditions.

I've spent years at the intersection of these problems: neural networks, automotive systems, manufacturing at scale, raising capital, and running businesses. What I've learned keeps me focused on one thing: the convergence of AI, security, and supply chain is the defining problem of the next decade.

## Why This Matters

I'm Tarun Bhatt. I'm drawn to problems where technical depth meets operations execution and capital constraints. I like solving them—optimizing complex systems, making them safer, finding patterns across domains.

**What got me here:**
- Neural networks research → understanding how systems learn and fail
- Automotive systems engineering → learning to optimize complex, interdependent systems
- Investment banking and private equity → seeing how capital decisions get made under uncertainty
- CEO roles (critical minerals recycling, advanced manufacturing) → solving problems at scale under constraints
- MIT Applied AI (current) → diving deep into what's emerging in machine learning

I have patents in automotive acoustics and electric vehicle battery recycling. I've led through restructuring, raised capital, and built technical teams that shipped real products.

I've learned to see patterns others miss, and I genuinely enjoy solving problems at these intersections.

## Why Now?

Three forces converge right now:

1. **AI Systems Are Opaque and Running Hot** — We don't fully understand neural network weight formation, yet we're deploying them in critical systems. Security researchers are only beginning to map the attack surface.

2. **US Critical Minerals Are Scarce, and Competitors Know It** — Mining capacity is geopolitically controlled. Battery demand is accelerating exponentially. Supply chain timing is misaligned with deployment timelines. This isn't abstract: it's a hardware constraint.

3. **Leadership in Deep Tech Requires Integration** — The companies that win won't be purely technical or purely operational. They'll be led by people who understand silicon, supply chains, capital, and can communicate vision when the path is unclear.

This is defensibility: not just better technology, but resilience across all three dimensions.

## What I'm Thinking About

- How neural networks fail under adversarial inputs, and why automotive security models don't account for it
- Why vertical integration of critical minerals is the only real defensibility strategy
- How to evaluate deep tech companies when surface metrics mislead
- What separates companies that scale from those that fail
- The gap between technical excellence and business reality—and how leaders bridge it
