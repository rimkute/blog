# About

I enjoy working at the intersection of domains whose underlying frameworks rarely converge yet unlock outsized impact when strategically connected.

## Why This Matters

I'm drawn to problems where technical depth meets operations execution and capital constraints. I like solving them—optimizing complex systems, making them safer, finding patterns across domains.

**What got me here:**
- Neural networks research in acoustics → understanding how systems learn and fail
- Automotive systems engineering → learning to optimize complex, interdependent systems
- Investment banking and private equity → seeing how capital decisions get made under uncertainty
- CEO roles (critical minerals recycling, advanced manufacturing) → solving problems at scale under constraints
- MIT Applied AI (current) → diving deep into what's emerging in machine learning

I have authored patents in [automotive acoustics](https://patents.google.com/patent/US6767050B2/) and [electric vehicle battery recycling](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11682801B1/). I've led through restructuring, raised capital, and built technical teams that shipped real products.

I've learned to see patterns others miss, and I genuinely enjoy solving problems at these intersections.

## What I'm Focused On Now

I'm seeing the shape of the next problem. AI systems are advancing exponentially. Neural networks can solve perception problems at scales that were impossible ten years ago. But we don't fully understand them—neural network weights aren't intelligible, we can't explain decision boundaries, and we can't predict adversarial failure modes.

Yet this is being deployed in critical systems: autonomous vehicles, defense applications, infrastructure control systems. Without full understanding.

There's a supply chain story hidden underneath. AI compute demand is driving semiconductor scarcity. Semiconductors require rare materials. The US has a critical minerals shortage. The timing is misaligned with geopolitics.

And the leadership problem is different now. You can't just be a great technologist. You can't just be a great operator. You need to integrate technical depth, supply chain reality, capital mechanics, and clear vision.

That's the convergence problem. It's why I'm focused on:

- How neural networks fail under adversarial inputs, and why automotive security models don't account for it
- Why vertical integration of critical minerals is the only real defensibility strategy
- How to evaluate deep tech companies when surface metrics mislead
- What separates companies that scale from those that fail
- The gap between technical excellence and business reality—and how leaders bridge it
